**RAMLLintBear**
================

RAML Linter is a static analysis, linter-like, utility that will enforce
rules on a given RAML document, ensuring consistency and quality.
Note: Files should not have leading empty lines, else the bear fails to
identify the problems correctly.

This bear uses the 'ramllint' tool.
